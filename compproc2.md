# Computer Procurement at FUW

We need four items to launch a procurement call:

+ 3 offers, for which we can contact any Polish company to obtain a quote. It is acceptable to have vendor specifications in those three offers (such as MacBook Pro 14" with 1TB hard drive) and even model numbers. Any offer must contain the following three parts:
  +  the price
  +  the warranty information
  +  a delivery timeline 
+ A FUW physics 'wniosek'. Find it at [wniosek](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/tl_files/dokumenty/zamowienia/aktualnosci/Wniosek_pow_30_tys_EUR_2018.docx)
+ An 'Analiza potrzeb i wymagań'. This is a legally required public procurement document available in word format.
+ Specifications. Those specifications have the requirements that the offers of point 1 fulfill. They have to be written without explicit reference to any vendor (e.g. Dell or Intel). However, implicit references to vendors (such as W880 or x710-da2) seem to be acceptable.

With those documents, procurement may be approached and a competition launched.

Companies procurement has approached in the past include Spinel, GigaMultimedia, Format Sp z o.o, and Techmaq.
