# Gull group at the University of Warsaw
As of summer 2025, the Gull group will have openings at the Physics Department of the University of Warsaw as a part of the ERC Advanced grant Quantum Algorithms. **Openings are available for postdocs, PhD students, and master students** on research topics in condensed matter theory and high-performance computing, including the development of field-theoretic methods for realistic correlated electron systems and their application to systems of interest. A wide range of topics is available. Previous work (see below) provides a general overview of the research areas.
The Gull group will maintain an affiliation with the [University of Michigan](https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/gull-lab/).

# Available positions
## Postdoc positions
Postdocs are required to have a PhD at the time of their employment. Areas include computational and/or analytical condensed matter theory, applied mathematics, quantum chemistry, and/or high-performance computing. Experience with modern analytic or numerical methods in quantum theory is desired. Experience with numerical methods in physics and a solid foundation in code development is especially welcome.

Interested parties should contact emanuel.gull@gmail.com for information.

To apply, send your application including a cover letter, curriculum vitae, list of publications, statement of re‚Äã‚Äê
search interests, and the three most rele‚Äãvant publi‚Äãcations in a single PDF file. Please also have two reference letters sent to this email.

For full consideration please ensure that all materials are **submitted by 5 Aug 2025**. Evaluations will continue on a rolling basis until all positions are filled. 

Note that postdoc positions will be advertized in a staggered fashion, one to two positions at a time. The official ads are now online at the following links:
