1. We need to get the visitor into the system. Send the visitor here:

https://visitors.uw.edu.pl/en-gb/

Following the rather silly instructions here:

The guest should register the arrival via the web page:
https://visitors.uw.edu.pl/en-gb/
Please fill only fields which are required.
  Registration is a 2-step process:
STEP 1. CREATE AN ACCOUNT (from the top right corner menu).
After creating the account, fill in the personal data in  MY ACCOUNT.
Next fill in the 3 sections in PERSONAL FORMS:
Basic personal data,
Address and contact information,
Additional personal information.
(fill just basic info, so the system lets you in).
  STEP 2. REGISTRATION OF THE VISIT
Here is the shortcut to the relevant selection page:
https://visitors.uw.edu.pl/en-gb/offer/REJESTRACJA-2022/registration/
  Please  select:

  and then click "SIGN UP", …and fill Question set.

2. Have the visitor provide all documentation needed for the WhyNotTravel Wniosek, which one can get from [here](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/dokumenty-i-formularze.html), direct link [here](https://www.fuw.edu.pl/tl_files/dokumenty/wyjazdy/2023-12-18_Zlecenie-zakupu-biletu-UW.docx)

4. Ask secretaries to provide Wniosek for invitations and hotels given that the visitor is in the UW system. Fill in visitor Wniosek given the dates provided on WhyNotTravel wniosek.

3. Submit WhyNotTravel Wniosek to secretariat and get it signed.
  
5. Cycle back to WhyNotTravel after WhyNotTravel Wniosek has been signed to order ticket
