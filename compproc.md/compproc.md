#Computer Procurement at FUW

We need four items to launch a procurement call:

- 3 offers, for which we can contact any Polish company to obtain a quote. It is acceptable to have vendor specifications in those three offers (such as MacBook Pro 14" with 1TB hard drive) and even model numbers. Any offer must contain the following three parts:
- -- the price
- -- the warranty information
- -- a delivery timeline 
- A FUW physics document. Unclear what it is.
- An 'Analysis'. Unclear what it is.
- Specifications. Those specifications have the requirements that the offers of point 1 fulfill. They have to be written without explicit reference to any vendor (e.g. Dell or Intel). However, implicit references to vendors (such as W880 or x710-da2) seem to be acceptable.

With those documents, procurement may be approached and a competition launched.
